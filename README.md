## Usage

## Assumptions About Input

## Project Structure and Dependencies
### External Project Packages
We depend on the `rsa` module provided by the Python Package Index.
It can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/), and should be
installed on the running machine with `pip install rsa` or
`pip3 install rsa` prior to running any of our code.

We depend on hashing functions provided by `pip3 install hashlib`
as well. TODO: expand on this library/installation instructions
TODO: looks like hashlib is already part of python core modules?

We have configured our code such that `pip3 install -e .` should install
the package as well as all dependencies. This is done during the make
procedures. TODO: Make the previous statement not a lie
